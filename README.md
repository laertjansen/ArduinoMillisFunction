I created this project to demonstrate how to use the millis() function to manage timing in Arduino without using delay(). LEDs blink at different intervals, and the motors react to a PIR sensor. The setup includes LEDs, motors, a PIR sensor, and a motor driver.
For this, I used LEDs, motors, a PIR sensor, and a motor driver.
